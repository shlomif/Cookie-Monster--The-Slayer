Emma Watson: Well, this isn't exactly how the original

but we're allowed to improvise, aren't we?

+++: Hmmm… it is now [she looks at her watch] 10 a.m., so we've got time until
lunch, and I'm rather hungry.

The children: Yeah, we're hungry too.

Emma Watson: OK, would you like some icecream?

Emma Watson: Let's go then.

[The kids and Emma enter <a href="https://www.vaniglia.co.il/">Vaniglia</a>
at Ibn Gabirol st. There are two vendors - Ronen, a male in his 20s to the right,
and Efrat, an 18 years old female.]

Ronen: Shalom…

Emma: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%94">uvrakhah</a>!
[she winks] but my Hebrew, or at least those of some of our viewers' [she waves towards the camera] are quite rudimentary, so let's speak English.

Ronen: oh sure, welcome to Vaniglia, I am Ronen, and this is Efrat.

Emma: Pleasure to meet you. I'm Emma.

+++: [to the children] OK, I know you kids can get indecisive, so please
don't waste too much time on choosing flavours. They are extremely unlikely
to be poisonous.

A kid: sure!

[They go to order. Emma heads towards Efrat.]

Emma: Okay, can I leave a tip using my credit card?

Efrat: sorry! It is not possible.

Emma: in that case [she pulls out her wallet] take these four 100 Sheqel notes.
And keep the change as a tip.

Efrat: wow, this is a lot to pay, Emma…

Emma: Watson! Emma Watson! I would have thought the shirt is a dead give away,
but I guess <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/26/designing-for-people-who-have-better-things-to-do-with-their-lives/">one
cannot expect people to read</a>.

Efrat: [looks at Emma 's shirt and name tag] Oh my god! You're the Emma Watson!
This is so cool! I'm too young to have watched the Harry Potter films,
but I loved you on <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/">Selina Mandrake</a>. I even donated 20 dollars for the pledge to make
it <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-by</a>. My
father donated even more.

Emma: thanks, that was generous of you.

Ronen: Emma, so what shall I give you?

Emma: Mango, chocolate, and lemon - in a cone - with the lemon scoop at the bottom.

Ronen: no problem, but we have dark chocolate, orange…

Emma: dark chocolate!

Ronen: coming right up…

[Cut to Efrat.]

Efrat: OK, here is the change and the receipt.

Emma: Thanks! [puts the change in the tips' glass jar.]

Efrat: So, how do you like it here?

Emma: To be honest, it does not feel much different from Greater London.
It is warmer, and there is a wider selection of food, and there's Hebrew
and stuff, but… feels right at home.

Efrat: And what's the deal with these kids?

Emma: Oh that… Well, their parents approached me in Olamot Con, while I
was chatting with some other attendees. They told me they were looking
for someone to babysit them until about 1 o'clock. I told them I'd do it
(because I always <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#getting-help-with-cuneiform">try to help others</a>)
and they felt they can trust me.

+++: So I took these children on a walk and then told them our own variation
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King">The Lion King</a>
and now I'm buying them icecream. They are sweet kids and they have only talked
in English in my presence so I'd be able to understand what they say.

Efrat: Sounds great!

Emma: Now what about you?

Efrat: Well, I'm in the twelfth grade now, and planning to be a software
dev in the army… I mean the military. I'm good at maths and been programming
since the third grade, and
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces">IDF</a>
is desperate for software devs and it's something I do enjoy.

Emma: Good luck, well, I'd better eat my icecream, here is my card - you can
IM me when your shift's over and we can meet somewhere near the con.

+++: … oh wait, I nearly forgot - would you two like to record a video with me?

Ronen: Yes, please, here - you can use my phone.

[One of the children takes the phone and records.]

Ronen: Hi, I'm Ronen!

Efrat: And I'm Efrat!

Emma: And I'm Emma Watson.

Emma: Thank you, and good bye.
